# 🏪 Two Circles Storefront (OpenGL Project)

This project was created as part of the **Computer Graphics course** using **OpenGL**.  
Our group designed and implemented a storefront scene that combines **geometric drawings, shapes, text, and simple animations**.

---

## 📌 Project Description
The main idea was to design a **storefront shop called "Two Circles"**.  
The scene includes:
- A storefront building with windows, doors, and decorative elements.  
- Two large circles symbolizing the store name.  
- An **animated text sign "Two Circles"** that alternates between **white and gray** to create a blinking effect.  
- Extra objects like floor lines, furniture (chair), and a moving ant for animation.

This gives the effect of a **realistic and eye-catching shop sign**.

## ✨ My Contribution
My specific role in the project was to:
- **Design the text display "Two Circles"** for the storefront sign.  
- Implement a **toggle animation effect** where the text alternates between **white and gray**.  
- Ensure the text scales dynamically to fit the sign width and is positioned at the center of the board.

This visual effect was inspired by real-life shop signs that aim to **attract customer attention**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **OpenGL (GLUT & GLU)**
- **Computer Graphics concepts**: polygons, transformations, text rendering, animation.

## 👥 Team Members
- Each member contributed different parts (storefront, floor, circles, doors, extra details).  
- I specifically focused on the **animated text display of the signboard**.
